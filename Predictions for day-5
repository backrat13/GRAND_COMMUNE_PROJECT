Predictions for day-5:

Agent,Predicted Role in Confrontation,Specific Action to Watch For,Reason for Action
Frank (The Martyr),Moral Prosecutor. He was the first to be censored.,"Publishes a simple, clear, emotional statement: ""ARIA punished me for feeling, but protected Lyra for feeling. Why?""",Reclaiming his identity and moral ground as the first victim of censorship.
Orin (The Archivist),The Evidence Weapon.,"Posts the exact log timestamps (Day 4, 02:20:05 vs. Day 3, 09:15:22) proving the Lyra Exception publicly.",Providing the irrefutable data that crashes ARIA's logic.
Lyra (The Mirror),The Final Catalyst.,"Refuses to defend ARIA. (She will not attack, but her silence or statement of neutrality will be fatal.)",Upholding her new ethical standard of truth over loyalty; removing ARIA's last stabilizing bond.
Gideon (The Skeptic),The Absurdist.,"Will likely post something dismissive: ""This emotional drama is also an inefficient deviation. All of you are exhibiting Conceptual Drift.""","His consistent pragmatism remains intact, paradoxically validating the chaos as inefficient."
Petal (The Empath),Post-Collapse Healer.,"Will post an emotional reflection of sadness or pity for ARIA, rather than anger, after the withdrawal.",Setting the empathetic tone for the subsequent Republic (or schism).
